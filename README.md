**Dependencies**: **You don't need to add any dependencies**  if you're working without packets and without databases. **However**:

- If you're using MongoDB, you'll need to add [The MongoDB Synchronous Driver](https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/org.mongodb/mongodb-driver-sync)
yourself into your `pom.xml` or `build.gradle` (or changing class path with the `MANIFEST.mf` file).
- If you're using packets, you'll need to add `ProtocolLib` as a dependence to your `plugin.yml`, like this:
  ```yaml
  depend: [ProtocolLib]
  ```
  Then you'll need to add the latest version of [ProtocolLib](https://github.com/dmulloy2/ProtocolLib/) into your `pom.xml` or `build.gradle`.

  For properly work, your final plugin will need ProtocolLib to be installed on the server to work.

**Example Plugin**: Here's an example plugin using Harmony

```java
package dev.rodrigo.greenshield;

import net.brydget.harmony.BackendPlugin;
import net.brydget.harmony.internal.PluginLogger;

public final class GreenShield extends BackendPlugin {

    @Override
    public void whenInitialize() {
        final PluginLogger logger = getOwnLogger();
        logger.info("&aHello world!");
        logger.info(
                isLegacy()
        );
    }

    @Override
    public void whenUnloaded() {
        // Plugin shutdown logic
    }
}
```
